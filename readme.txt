ZombiEvade is a zombie survival game with the objective to survive as long as possible while collecting the zombies’ hearts. It is a singleplayer 2D top-down game. The player can move in 4 directions (up, down, left, right) and has access to 2 abilities. The first ability is a sword swing which does damage to all enemies in a cone in front of the player. The second ability allows the player to eat one of the hearts they have collected to regain some of their hitpoints.
